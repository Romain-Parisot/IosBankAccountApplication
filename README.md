# IosBankAccountApplication

## Overview

The IosBankAccountApplication is a financial management app project designed during an IOS course in my IIM formation. 
The goal was to create a simple app to familiarize with xCode and Swift, so i made an app to allow users to track their transactions, visualize their income and expenses, and manage their financial data.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Login View**: A login interface where users can log in to access the app.
- **Logout Functionality**: Users can log out of the application, redirecting them back to the login view.

 `This will check if the email and password fields are filled, i did not have retricted to a specific value to make it user friendly while testing`


### 2. Dark Mode Support
- The app supports a dark mode.
- Users can toggle between dark and light modes via the menu.

### 3. Transaction Management
- **Transactions View**: Users can view all their transactions organized by date.
- **Random Transaction Generation**: The app generates a random set of transactions with details like amount, category, and date.
- **Categorization**: Transactions are categorized into different types (e.g., Fuel, Restaurant, Healthcare, Investments) with associated icons.

### 4. Financial Visualization
- **Wallet Visualizer**: A visual representation of income, spending, and investing through colored circles to give users a quick overview of their financial health, the bigger the circle is the higher the amount associated is.

### 5. Menu Functionality
- An animated menu that allows users to toggle dark mode and log out.

### 6. Minimalist UX/UI
- As you might seen the design is imsipred by the TradeRepublic AD.
